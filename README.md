# Indeed-Web-Scraping
The code provided can enable you to web scrape job postings from Indeed.com.
It has been implemented in 2 ways, one using the Selenium web driver and the other using the
package Beautiful Soup.
These can be installed as follows:
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install selenium
Using the selenium web driver
Currently we have set the default browser as Google Chrome. In order to extract jobs from
Indeed using Selenium, the appropriate driver must be installed. See this link to download an
appropriate driver for the Google Chrome browser.
